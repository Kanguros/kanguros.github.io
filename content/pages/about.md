Hi, I'm Kamil,

a DevOps Engineer with over five years of experience in automation solutions and a broader background in IT. My passion
for Python extends to network tasks. I'm adept at CI/CD pipelines and network automation. I have a solid understanding
of networks, having worked with Cisco, Palo Alto, F5, and others, mainly from an automation, scripting, and data
analysis perspective. I would never call myself a network engineer but I have considerable knowledge of enterprise
networks and the network itself.

In recent years, I focused on automating network tasks, improving efficiency and reliability. I advocate for using code
to manage infrastructure, ensuring consistency. I've created guides and resources to share knowledge.

I also have my own way of thinking about work. I like making things that run by themselves, so we don't always have to
keep an eye on them. I love to learn and solve problems, especially when I have no idea what I'm doing.

This blog is more than my articles; it's a public version of my private notepad, filled with thoughts on technology and
automation, programming insights, and my unique theories.
