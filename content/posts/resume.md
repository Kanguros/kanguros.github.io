summary: Started in/at the bottom of a food chain as a Engineer in Master Control Room team. After a while I changed it to being a *secretary* of a Network Squad Product/Owner. As time pass by, I learned that my laziness have different meanings Network Automation and DevOps. From that day, I''m trying to tell everyone around me why and how to do it.
