I've still remember, how complicated was the process of creating _my own website_ 10 years ago. Starting from finding
free or cheap server which would host my website too tremendous amount of technologies required to be used (HTML, CSS
and PHP) in order to setup a website. My knowledge and experience might also have a influence on _complexity_ of the
process but nevertheless, a lot has changed for the past few years in IT.

Here is the few steps that blog is build upon.

## Generating - Pelican

The blog is a static site generated with the usage of Python's library [`pelican`](https://blog.getpelican.com/).

## Hosting - Github Pages

As it is a webpage which consist only from HTML and CSS files, there is no need for any fancy server. I've
picked [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

> Hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.

## Writing - Markdown

One of the reasons I've looked at static site generators was that most of them use _Markdown_ for writing its content. I
am personally, very fond of _Markdown_.
