## Azure DevOps and Software Development

### Azure DevOps

[Official Documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/)

A set of development tools and services provided by Microsoft to help teams plan, develop, test, and deliver software
efficiently. It includes features like version control, project management, CI/CD, and more.

### Azure Repos

[Official Documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/repos/)

A version control service in Azure DevOps that provides Git and Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) repositories for
source code management.

### Azure Pipelines

[Official Documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/pipelines/)

A service in Azure DevOps that provides continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for building, testing, and
deploying applications.

**Example**

An example pipeline definition with testing, linting, building, and publishing a Python package, triggered on the master
branch.

```yaml
trigger:
    branches:
        include:
            - master

jobs:
    - job: BuildTestPackage
      displayName: "Build, Test, and Package"
      pool:
          vmImage: "ubuntu-latest"

      steps:
          - task: UsePythonVersion@0
            inputs:
                versionSpec: "3.x"
            displayName: "Use Python 3.x"

          - script: |
                python -m pip install --upgrade pip
                pip install -r requirements.txt
            displayName: "Install dependencies"

          - script: |
                python -m unittest discover tests
            displayName: "Run tests"

          - script: |
                flake8 --ignore=E501 .
            displayName: "Lint code"

          - script: |
                python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
            displayName: "Build package"

          - task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
            inputs:
                targetPath: "$(Pipeline.Workspace)/dist"
                artifact: "package"
            displayName: "Publish package artifact"
```

## Programming and Development

### Python

[Official Documentation](https://www.python.org/)

A popular, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used for various
tasks, including web development, data analysis, automation, and more.

**Example**

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")


greet("John Doe")
```

### PowerShell

[Official Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/)

A scripting language and automation framework developed by Microsoft. It is primarily used for task automation and
configuration management in Windows environments. PowerShell provides extensive access to system APIs and is well-suited
for managing Azure resources.

**Example**

```powershell
$firstName = "John"
$lastName = "Doe"
Write-Host "Hello, $firstName $lastName!"
```

### Ansible

[Official Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html)

A powerful open-source automation tool that simplifies the management and configuration of IT infrastructure. It uses a
declarative language to describe the desired state of systems and automates tasks such as software installation,
configuration management, and orchestration.

**Example**

```yaml
- name: Ensure Nginx is installed
  hosts: web_servers
  tasks:
      - name: Install Nginx
        apt:
            name: nginx
            state: present
```

### Docker

[Official Documentation](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)

An open-source platform that allows developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable
containers. Containers provide a consistent and

isolated environment for running applications.

**Example**

A Dockerfile for a Python application:

```
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD [ "python", "app.py" ]
```

### Kubernetes

A popular open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of
containerized applications.

### Container

A lightweight and isolated execution environment that allows the packaging and running of applications with their
dependencies.

## Automation and Scripting

### Automation

The process of using technology to automatically perform tasks without human intervention. It involves writing scripts
or using tools to streamline and simplify repetitive or complex processes.

### Scripting

The process of writing small programs (scripts) that automate specific tasks. Scripts are typically written in scripting
languages like Python and are used to simplify repetitive actions or automate complex operations.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

The practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure resources (such as virtual machines, networks, and storage)
using code. It allows infrastructure to be treated as code, providing benefits like version control, reproducibility,
and automation.

**Example**

```yaml
resources:
    - name: my-vm
      type: compute
      properties:
          vmSize: Standard_DS2_v2
          osDisk:
              storageAccountType: Premium_LRS
          networkProfile:
              networkInterfaces:
                  - id: /subscriptions/subscription-id/resourceGroups/resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/my-nic
```

### Configuration as Code

The practice of managing and configuring software systems using code. It involves defining the desired state of a system
in code and using automation to apply and maintain that configuration.

**Example**

```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
      - name: Install Apache
        yum:
            name: httpd
            state: latest
      - name: Start Apache
        service:
            name: httpd
            state: started
```

## File Formats

### YAML

[Official Documentation](https://yaml.org/)

A human-readable data serialization language used for configuration files, including defining pipelines and workflows.
It is often used in Azure DevOps to define build and release pipelines.

**Example**

```yaml
name: John Doe
age: 30
occupation: Engineer
contacts:
    - email: john.doe@example.com
      phone: 123456789
    - email: jane.smith@example.com
      phone: 987654321
```

### CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

A plain text file format commonly used for storing tabular data. It uses commas to separate values in each row.

**Example**

```csv
name      ,age,occupation,email
John Doe  ,30 ,Engineer  ,john.doe@example.com
Jane Smith,25 ,Developer ,jane.smith@example.com
```

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

A lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and
generate. It is widely used for data serialization and communication between systems.

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "occupation": "Engineer",
    "contacts": [
        {
            "email": "john.doe@example.com",
            "phone": "123456789"
        },
        {
            "email": "jane.smith@example.com",
            "phone": "987654321"
        }
    ]
}
```

### XML (eXtensible Markup Language)

A markup language that defines rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and
machine-readable. It is used for representing structured data and exchanging information between

different systems.

**Example**

```xml

<person>
    <name>John Doe</name>
    <age>30</age>
    <occupation>Engineer</occupation>
    <contacts>
        <contact>
            <email>john.doe@example.com</email>
            <phone>123456789</phone>
        </contact>
        <contact>
            <email>jane.smith@example.com</email>
            <phone>987654321</phone>
        </contact>
    </contacts>
</person>
```
